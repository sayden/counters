Historically, a "counter" in the wargame context is just a name that refers to a piece you interact
with in a boardgame. Inside this project, it's more like a template for that piece and how it is
defined.

<Image class="float-right pl-[1ch]" src={whatIsACounter} alt="counter" />

Every of these counters, might contain images or texts. For example, the counter at the right,
contains 2 texts (`HELLO` and `COUNTER`) and 1 image (the black and white cirle on the top).

## Positions

<Image class="float-right pl-[1ch] w-1/5" src={positionAll} alt="counter" />

Each text or image will be positioned at the center by default. To define a different place, 
we provide with a set of 17 fixed positions.

So, you will define a text, like `COUNTER` and then say that you want it on the bottom-center of 
the counter, which is position 11.

  Guess where is the position of the image in the counter above?

  <Reveal client:load>
> Answer: Position 3.
  </Reveal>

  What about the text `HELLO`?

  <Reveal client:load>
> Answer: Position 0, the default position.
  </Reveal>
</Aside>

## Attributes

Finally, each text and image can contain more than 25 different properties. Some of them are common,
like `position` and some of them are specific like `font_color` for texts or `scaling` for images.

Using those attributes, you can change the shape of texts or the color. And you can also rotate
or scale images.
