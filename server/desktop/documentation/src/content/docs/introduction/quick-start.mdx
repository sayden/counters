Historically, a "counter" in the wargame context is just a name that refers to a piece you interact
with in a boardgame. Inside this project, it's more like a template for that piece
and how it is defined.

<Code lang="json" mark={['texts', 'images']} code={`
{
  "texts": [
    {
      "string": "Hello",
      "font_height": 25
    },
    {
      "position": 11,
      "string": "Counter",
      "font_color": "white"
    }
  ],
  "images": [
    {
      "position": 3,
      "path": "myassets/supply.png",
      "scale": 0.3
    }
  ]
}
`} />

You can see, there's 2 root elements: `texts` and `images`.
Texts are a list of text definitions which requires, at least, a mandatory `string` property.
Images are a list of image definitions and each of them requires, at least, a mandatory `path` property.

## Creating texts

In the example above, the `texts` array contains 2 elements. The first text contains the text `Hello`,
which you define using the `string` property. Then the size of the text is changed to `25` px using the optional `font_height` property.
You can see the text `HELLO` in the center of the counter.

import positionAll from '../../../assets/position_all.png';

<Image class="float-right pl-[1ch]" src={positionAll} alt="counter" />

The second text item, with the `string` `COUNTER` changes the `font_color` to white.
But this text is in the bottom of the piece. This is define by the `position` property. And why the position is 11?
Look at the image on the right. Each number is a position on the piece, being 0, the center; the default position (now you know
why the text "HELLO" was positioned in the center without any `position` defined property).

## Creating images

The only image in the `images` array contains an arleady familiar `position` property on the 3rd
position (at the top-center of the counter).

## The settings

Each text and image can contain more than 25 different properties. Some of them are common, like
`position` and some of them are specific like `font_color` for texts or `scaling` for images.

I'll make a list with all of them, but I'll write here only most commonly used:

- `position`: The position of the text or image in the counter. It's a number from 0 to 16. The first position is the top-left corner. The second position is the top-middle. And so on.
- `font_color`: (Text only) The color of the text. It can be a hexadecimal color or a string color. For example, `font_color: "#0F0"` or `font_color: "red"`.
- `background_color`: The background color of the text. It can be a hexadecimal color or a string color. For example, `background_color: "#0F0"` or `background_color: "red"`.
- `x_shift`, `y_shift`: Displacement of the object on the counter on the x or y axis, like `"x_shift": 70`
- `alignment`: The alignment of the text. It can be `center`, `right` or `left`.
- `image_scaling`: The scaling of the image. It can be `fitWidth`, `wrap` or `fit

## The template

Finally, every conuter belongs to a template overarching JSON object. This template defines global
properties for all the counters, that can later be overridden by the counters themselves.

For example, the template can define the default font size for all the counters, or the default
background color for all the counters.

<Code lang="json" mark={['"counters"']} code={`
{
    "working_directory": "/your/path",
    "rows": 7,
    "columns": 7,
    "width": 82,
    "height": 82,
    "margins": 2,
    "font_height": 30,
    "font_color": "black",
    "mode": "template",
    "output_folder": "generated/counters/test",
    "font_path": "assets/font-bebas.ttf",
    "counters": [
    ...
    ]
}`} />

The `counters` property is where you'll write every counter definition. So, in the end, how does
it look like?

<Code lang="json" code={`
{
    "working_directory": "/your/path",
    "rows": 7,
    "columns": 7,
    "width": 82,
    "margins": 2,
    "height": 82,
    "font_height": 25,
    "font_color": "black",
    "mode": "template",
    "output_folder": "generated/counters/test",
    "font_path": "assets/font-bebas.ttf",
    "counters": [
        {
          "texts": [
            {
              "string": "Hello",
              "font_height": 20
            },
            {
              "position": 11,
              "string": "Counter",
              "font_color": "blue"
            }
          ],
          "images": [
            {
              "position": 3,
              "path": "assets/supply.png",
              "scale": 0.12
            }
          ]
        }
    ]
}
`} />

import generatedCounter from '../../../assets/basic-generated-counter.png';

<Image src={generatedCounter} alt="counter" />

## Prototypes

The most advanced feature of this project is the prototypes. A prototype is a template that can be
used to create multiple counters that share some format. `prototypes` is a map (not an array like
`counters` array) that contains common `counter` JSON objects with the the special properties
`text_prototypes` and `image_prototypes`.

<Code lang="json" mark={['"prototypes"', "my_prototype", "text_prototypes", "image_prototypes", "path_list", "string_list"]} code={`
{
  "working_directory": "/mypath",
  "rows": 7,
  "columns": 7,
  "width": 82,
  "height": 82,
  "font_height": 20,
  "margins": 5,
  "font_color": "black",
  "background_color": "#b08619",
  "mode": "template",
  "output_folder": "generated/counters/test",
  "draw_guides": false,
  "stroke_color": "black",
  "image_scaling": "fitWidth",

  "font_path": "assets/font-bebas.ttf",
  "prototypes": {
    "my_prototype": {
      "texts": [{ "position": 11, "string": "HQ" }],
      "text_prototypes": [
        {
          "position": 3,
          "string_list": ["First", "Second", "Third"]
        }
      ],
      "image_prototypes": [
        {
          "scale": 0.3,
          "path_list": [
            "assets/supply.png",
            "assets/supply.png",
            "assets/supply.png"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
`} />
